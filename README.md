### Background Image

- The background image chosen for this game is of the instantly recognisable Edinburgh Castle. This image was chosen as the Castle is located within the Scottish capital and represents hiistoriical significance to the people of Scotland. Another reason it was picked is that the image itself is beautiful...just like Scotland!

### Font Style

- The header on the home page will be UnifrakturCook from Google Fonts. This has been chosen due to it medieval appearance which compliments the background image of Edinburgh Castle

## Credits 

- In preperation for this project I reached out to some of my fellow Code Institute Students and Alumni and was made aware of an excellant tutorial on youTube for creating multiple choice quiz's using javascript. This tutorial assited me greatly with preparing and completing this project. Some of the code including the JavaScript used for parts of the question and answers as well as to store users scores and update the leaderboard that I have used has been taken from this tutorial and adapted where necessary to complete this project. - [James Q Quick Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx)
