# The Scottish Quiz

The Scottish Quiz is exactly that, a quiz about Scotland. This is a fun, interactive multiple choice quiz aimed to test and broaden the users knowledge of Bonnie Scotland! This quiz is aimed at people of all ages.
There is 10 multiple choice questions and the user will have 10 seconds answer each of them. As the quiz progresses so does the difficulty level of each question.

## Design

- For this project I initially sketched how I intended for the game to look on a notepad. I thereafter used Balsamiq Wireframes to plan the project as shown below.

### Home Page

  - The home page will feature the heading at the top of the page with the name of this quiz, the main background image of the beautiful Edinburgh Castle with game instructions and finally the start button to begin the game.

### Background Image

- The background image chosen for this game is of the instantly recognisable Edinburgh Castle. This image was chosen as the Castle is located within the Scottish capital and represents hiistoriical significance to the people of Scotland. Another reason it was picked is that the image itself is beautiful...just like Scotland!

### Font Style

- The header on the home page will be UnifrakturCook from Google Fonts. This has been chosen due to it medieval appearance which compliments the background image of Edinburgh Castle

- All other text will be typed using tinos from Google Fonts. This has been chosen due to its simple, clean appearance which should allow the user to read the content of the game ie instructions and questions etc with ease.

### Colours

- The colours to be used throughout this project will be blue and white to represent the colours of the Scottish Flag.
